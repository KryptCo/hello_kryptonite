# hello_kryptonite
A test repository to clone using Kryptonite.

__Kryptonite__ generates and stores an SSH key pair on a mobile phone. The
Kryptonite app is paired with one or more workstations by scanning a QR code
presented in the terminal. When using SSH from a paired workstation, the
workstation requests a private key signature from the phone. The user then
receives a notification and chooses whether to allow the SSH login.
